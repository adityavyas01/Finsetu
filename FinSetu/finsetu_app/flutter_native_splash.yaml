flutter_native_splash:
  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.
  # Customize the parameters below, and run the following command:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create
  
  # Background color of the splash screen
  color: "#000000"
  
  # You can also use a color generated from an image by using background_image parameter
  # The image will be resized to cover the entire screen
  # background_image: "assets/images/background.png"
  
  # The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image
  image: assets/images/icon.png
  
  # The branding property allows you to specify an image used as branding in the splash screen
  # branding: assets/images/finsetu_logo.png
  
  # The image_dark, color_dark, and background_image_dark set values that
  # apply when the device is in dark mode
  color_dark: "#000000"
  image_dark: assets/images/icon.png
  
  # Android 12 handles the splash screen differently than previous versions
